# Open-Pose and Tertiary qualities

# WIP

This project is a *work in progress*. The implementation is *incomplete* and subject to change. The documentation can be inaccurate.

# Brief

Open-Pose is a C++ library for real-time Multi-Person Keypoint Detection developed at the Carnegie Mellon University. As mentioned at its project repository [https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose):

OpenPose represents the first real-time system to jointly detect human body, hand and facial keypoints (in total 130 keypoints) on single images. In addition, the system computational performance on body keypoint estimation is invariant to the number of detected people in the image.

The published article by its authors is at:

This project is using this library for tertiary artistic qualities, mainly simplification and remotion of qualities in the real-time videos as to get an abstract artistic form.
